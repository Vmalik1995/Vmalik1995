### Outline

* Analyze the data containing 150000 rows , 24 columns using Pandas.
* Using Pandas, Seaborn, Plotly to analyze and visualize data.
* Max Profit, Total State Margin, Cities selling most categories of liquor and the store selling most alcohol in the month

### Summary

* Cedar Rapids, selling 67 categories Iowa City, West Des Moines, Des Moines : selling 66 Categories each, Davenport, selling 65 Categories.
* The total volume of alcohol sold is 1339149.4600000002 liters.
* The state profit was maximum on 4th November with 247000(Dollars) as total Profit.
* There are 70 different categories of liquor constituting everyday sales in the Iowa state.

## 3.Flight Delay Prediction using MachineLearning
[https://jovian.com/ghost-smith9557/flightdelays-1](url)

### Outline

* Cleaned and Analyzed flight delays dataset containing 52 million rows * 31columns.
* Use the scikit-learn, Ridge Regression, Gradient Boosting , Random Forest Regressor models to train and predict the delay.
* The predicted delay is 17 seconds , RMSE is of 61seconds, as our dataset is widely spread.

### Summary

* The data is widely spread , so the RMSE is high if seen in figures.
* Our final model of RandomForestRegressor has a score of 84.48% for training, and 80.01% for testing, which is very optimal.
* Hawaiian Airlines are more reliable to travel with
